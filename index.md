### Computational Statistics: Gene Expression in Endometriosis

Endometriosis is a painful gynecological disorder that affects nearly 10% of women worldwide. We utilized publicly available microarray data containing archived endometrial samples from
women with different stages of endometriosis to derive gene expression signatures of the disease.
We then used the results of our differential analysis to construct and compare classification models to predict endometriosis for a given sample.

### Causal Inference: Yelp Reviews and Restaurant Closure

Websites such as Yelp have been created to quickly and easily convey relevant information about eateries: location, price, cuisine type, as well as a five star review system that summarizes the experiences of other diners. As one would expect, restaurants with the highest reviews tend to be the most successful. Or are they? The goal of this research project was to assess the importance of favorable Yelp reviews on restaurant closure: in other words, do lower Yelp reviews cause restaurant closure?

### Classification: Predicting Contraceptive Use

We aimed to understand how socioeconomic features impact contraceptive use, acknowledging factors such as access and cost may have such an influence. We utilized a survey of married household data on various demographic and socioeconomic factors collected in Indonesia in 1987. The goals of our project were two-fold: 1) predict contraceptive use through a variety of socioeconomic features, and 2) identify the best modeling approach for prediction. Ultimately, we aimed to identify a bias in the Family Planning Program in order to improve the allocation of resources and outreach efforts regarding contraceptive use in the Indonesian population.

## Other Experiences

### Master's Thesis: Life Expectancy

My MA thesis investigated gaps in life expectancy between Black and White US residents, incorporating for Hispanic ethnicity. In particular, I focused on the contribution of three causes of death: opioid overdose, intentional self-harm, and homicide, with aims to identify state policies that may promote greater equity and reduce health disparities by race and ethnicity. Please check back here once my work becomes publicly available!

### Internship in Health Technology

I spent last summer interning at Catalia Health, a patient care management company in San Francisco. While I was lucky enough to work on a few projects, I focused on better understanding patterns in patient engagement/behavior. In addition to strengthening my knowledge in data analysis and programming, the opportunity taught me how the healthcare industry works, what it means to work at a fast-paced company, and how to balance collaboration with independence.
